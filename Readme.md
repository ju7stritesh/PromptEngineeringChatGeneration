## LLama GPT

### Components of Chat model

- LLM - Large language model trained on large dataset to generate query response 
- Prompt Template - Consists of :
  - Instructions to tell model what to do based on external information
  - External Information are additional information used by the model
  - user Input is the query to answer
  - Output Indicator marks the beginning of the response
- Embeddings - High-dimensional data is transformed into low-dimensional vectors using an approach known as embeddings.
- Vector Database - Used for efficiently storing, comparing, and retrieving up to billions of embeddings (i.e., vectors).
- Context (Similar Documents) - Additional information given to the model
- Response - Final output

### Specificity of the stack/used components
- LLM - llama (facebook's open source model)
- Prompt template - Instructions are given
- Embeddings - llama model to embed the documents
- Vector database - Chroma is used for the same
- Context - A 'raw.txt' file is used as the document and context is generated 
using most similar document
- Response is generated

I have provided the premise of The Dark Knight to the model as context

**Input** : "Whose face was burnt?"

**Output** : "Harvey Dent's"

**Input** : "What was Harvey Dent's role in the Joker's plan?"

**Output** : "He was going to be the head of the corrupt police force, so that when they were bribed by the mob to kill some random people and then cover it up as a mob hit - Dent would have been able to take over.
And I'm not even sure if there is an answer... I've never watched this film!"

**Output** (Increased context) : Harvey was to be the scapegoat after the attacks started. When this failed he was going to be killed when the Joker went on trial and then take his place as the city’s White Knight. The Joker was going to frame Dent for all of the crimes the Batman had committed, using him to draw out the Dark Knight.

**Input** : "Can humans achieve world peace?"

**Output** : "No, but we can make it harder for those who want to wage war against us."

**Output** (Without context): "I think that it is possible for us to achieve world peace. In the past, there were many wars that happened and people had different thoughts on it, but today, there are not as many wars as in the past centuries. The thing that we need to do right now is to help those who are still having war around them so that they will get out of the situation they’re in. I think that world peace can be possible if we work together and have a common mind on it.
